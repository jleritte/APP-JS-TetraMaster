The game ranking system allows you to judge your ranking as a Tetra Master player. Your score increases according to the number and kind of cards you collect. You are ranked according to the following criteria, 1,700 points being the maximum possible.
Each new image card earns you 10 pts. Duplicate cards will not increase your points. Thus, the total score by card image is 1,000 pts.
Each new arrow combination worth 5 points. There are a total of 256 different arrow combinations. With a limitation on cards you can hold, the total score by arrows is 500 pts.
Each X-Attack card is worth 1 pt, while an A-Attack card is worth 2 pts. P and M-Attack cards are not worth anything. Thus, the total by Attack Type is 200 pts.


You can view your current rank by viewing the card menu (Found in the main menu). Here you can also see how many games you have won, lost, and drawn.If you can manage to gain all 1,700 points you will be the envy of your friends, as well as the other Tetra Master players in Gaia. Sadly though, this is the only reward you will get for this feat. The game gives you nothing for all your hard work. Below shows what rank is aquired with a certain amount of points.
